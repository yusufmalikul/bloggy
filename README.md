# bloggy
A simple and stup*d blog generator written in Go.

# Status
Currently, bloggy is in a very early stage of development. It is not ready for production use.

# Why
I wanted to create a simple blog generator that is easy to use. I prefer static sites because it's cheap to host and maintain. It also reduce security risks for your server.

# Usage
Run this command to generate markdown file to your blog directory.

```
bloggy
```

After that, you can start bloggy as a server.
```
bloggy server
```

Visit http://localhost:8080 to see your blog. You can also deploy the static files to your server.
